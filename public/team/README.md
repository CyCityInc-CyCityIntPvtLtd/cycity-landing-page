## Image Generation Tips
- Use AI image generation tools (Midjourney, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion)
- Prompt suggestions: "professional headshot, futuristic tech aesthetic, dark background, high quality, corporate portrait"
- Ensure consistent lighting and style across all six images
- Consider the website's color scheme (lime green accents, dark theme)

The current files are placeholders and need to be replaced with actual professional portraits.
